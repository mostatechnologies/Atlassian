Find the appropriate version of jira and database.

Get DB ready:
Install Postgresql	
	apt install postgresql-xxversionxx
	
Stand alone instance(make sure uid and gid should be same on both serves)jira:x:1001:1001- 1- {$ usermod -u 1001 jira 2-$ groupmod -g 1001 jira}
**********************************
Get Node1 ready:

- Install OS as per jira compatibility
- make identical configuration like disk, memory, cpu, etc.
- Configure static IP, datetime, zone
- configure ssh for management purpose
- create file system

	mkdir -p /Atlassian/Jira/Application/
	mkdir -p /Atlassian/Jira/Data
	mkdir -p /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home


- mount "jira_shared_home" to the the NFS share following below.
	
	install nfs client	($ apt install nfs-common) 
	edit /etc/fstab and append below line.
		$ ano /etc/fstab
		192.168.200.126:/mnt/vg01/jira_shared_home/jira_shared_home     /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home        nfs     defaults        0       0
		$ mount -a (may be take reboot)
		
- Now Install Jira
	-download the installer .bin file from atlassian site and save it to local directory.
	- Make the installer executable
		$ sudo chmod a+x atlassian-jira-software-X.X.X-x64.bin
	- Run installer
		$ sudo ./atlassian-jira-software-X.X.X-x64.bin
	-Follow the prompts to install Jira. You'll be asked for the following info	
		Install type – choose option 2 (custom) for the most control. 
		Destination directory – this is where Jira will be installed.
		Home directory – this is where Jira data like logs, search indexes and files will be stored.
		TCP ports ( use default port as port 80 not allowed in linux system. Later we can forward the traffic using Nginx load balancer)
		Install as service-this option is only available if you ran the installer as sudo
		Once installation is complete head to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to begin the setup process. (Replace 8080 if you chose a different port during installation) . 
-Set up your Jira application
	-Choose set up method, I'll set it up myself.
	-Connect to your database
	-Set application properties
	-Enter your license
	- Create your administrator account

- Now start using Jira a stand alone system without any high availability.


Setup jira with Cluster setup.
********************************

-Now we can setup existing node as cluster node and then can add second node to the cluster.

-Stop your Jira instance.

-Copy the following directories from the Jira local home directory to the new sharedhome directory (some of them may be empty).
	(data, plugins, logos, import, export, caches, keys)
	- cp -R data /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/
	cp -R plugins /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/
	cp -R logos /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/
	cp -R import /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/
	cp -R export /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/
	cp -R caches /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/
	cp -R keys /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home/

- In the Jira local home directory, create a cluster.properties file, with contents as follows: 	
	jira.node.id = jira01.mostya.com
	jira.shared.home = /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home

-For Linux installations: We recommend that you increase the maximum number of open files. To do that, add the following line to <jira-install>/bin/setenv.sh:
	ulimit -n 16384- you might see thissetting on top of the file

 Now Setup your Nginx server first
******************************
- Install nginx server

	$ apt install nginx
	by default it will go to - /var/www/html
- make a directory to store your file for web application.(In the case of jira we will forward the request to jira server, here we can skip this step )

- Now we need to create a server block in the configuration file.
- We will copy the default file and make a newconfiguration file out of it.
	$ cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/defaut //etc/nginx/sites-available/www.jira.mostya.com
	now make some changes to the new file like below
	$ nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/www.jira.mostya.com.conf -add below content
		
		upstream backend {
				  ip_hash;
      				  server jira01.mostya.com:8080;
				  server jira02.mostya.com:8080;	

       				 }

        		server {
      			listen 80;
        			server_name www.jira.mostya.com;
        			location / {
       				 proxy_pass http://backend;
       				 }
     			}

- Now we have to enable this configuration (remeober to remove the old default config file before that)
	$ rm  /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
	$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/www.jira.mostya.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

- Next, check Nginx for any syntax error with the following command:

	$ nginx -t

-Restart the nginx server
	$ systemctl restart nginx

-Now you should be be redirecting to the Jira home page.

http://<jiraurl>/status

***************************************************************

-Get Node2 ready:
	-- Install OS: Same OS and version suggested
	 
- Verify if you are able to see the shared content?

- make identical configuration like disk, memory, cpu, etc.
- Configure static IP, datetime, zone
- configure ssh for management purpose
- create file same file system

	mkdir -p /Atlassian/Jira/Application/
	mkdir -p /Atlassian/Jira/Data
	mkdir -p /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home


- mount "jira_shared_home" to the the NFS share following below.
	
	install nfs client	($ apt install nfs-common) 
	edit /etc/fstab and append below line.
		$ ano /etc/fstab
		192.168.200.126:/mnt/vg01/jira_shared_home/jira_shared_home     /Atlassian/Jira/jira_shared_home        nfs     defaults        0       0
		$ mount -a (may be take reboot)

- Now Install Jira
	-download the installer .bin file from atlassian site and save it to local directory.
	- Make the installer executable
		$ sudo chmod a+x atlassian-jira-software-X.X.X-x64.bin
	- Run installer
		$ sudo ./atlassian-jira-software-X.X.X-x64.bin
	-Follow the prompts to install Jira. You'll be asked for the following info	
		Install type – choose option 2 (custom) for the most control. 
		Destination directory – this is where Jira will be installed.
		Home directory – this is where Jira data like logs, search indexes and files will be stored.
		TCP ports ( use default port as port 80 not allowed in linux system. Later we can forward the traffic using Nginx load balancer)
		Install as service-this option is only available if you ran the installer as sudo
		Once installation is complete head to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to begin the setup process. (Replace 8080 if you chose a different port during installation) . 
-Set up your Jira application
	- Now, when you see the setup wizard that means installation went well. Stop the jira sercive and configure further.
	- copy server.xml, dbconfig.xml and cluster.property file from first node to new node. Make sure they go to same directory path.
	- make neccessary changes in cluster.property file (change node.id)
	- Start the service and access the page.
	- In background synchronization process will kick in and will do the necessary cluster related task. 

You are good to go now.
